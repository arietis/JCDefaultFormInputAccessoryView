Why?
----

I needed to add Previous/Next/Done buttons in the input accessory view for most text fields/views. While I found several projects that already do this, none of them appeared to automatically adjust the positioning of the view or work correctly with a UITableView instance (since they depended on all of the input views being available on view load while a table view's cells are lazily loaded.)

What?
-----

JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryView allows to add an input accessory view to your view controllers that contains Previous/Next/Done buttons. Once configured with a list of responding items, the JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryView instance allows the user to cycle through the inputs (as Safari allows in a web form) and automatically ensures that the view is positioned so that the keyboard doesn't hide the input's view.

A working sample iOS Xcode project is available in the `Demo` directory.

Usage?
----

    #import "JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryView.h"
    #import "JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryViewResponderItem.h"
    
    @interface MyTableViewController : UITableViewController
    
    @property (strong, nonatomic) JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryView* inputAccessoryView;
    
    @end
    
    @implementation MyTableViewController
    
    - (void) viewDidLoad {
      [super viewDidLoad];
      
      self.inputAccessoryView = [JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryView defaultFormInputAccessoryView];
      
      NSMutableArray* responders = [NSMutableArray new];
      NSUInteger sectionCount = [self.tableView.dataSource numberOfSectionsInTableView:self.tableView];
      for (NSInteger section = 0; section < sectionCount; ++section) {
        NSUInteger rowCount = [self.tableView.dataSource tableView:self.tableView numberOfRowsInSection:section];
        for (NSInteger row = 0; row < rowCount; ++row) {
          NSIndexPath* indexPath = [NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:row inSection:section];
          JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryViewRespondingViewGetter respondingViewGetter = ^UIView *{
            UITableViewCell* cell = [self.tableView cellForRowAtIndexPath:indexPath];
            UITextField* textField;
            for (UIView* subview in cell.contentView.subviews) {
              if ([subview isKindOfClass:[UITextField class]]) {
                textField = (UITextField*)subview;
                break;
              }
            }
            return textField;
          };
          [responders addObject:[JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryViewResponderItem itemWithContainingTableView:self.tableView
                                                                                                indexPath:indexPath
                                                                                     respondingViewGetter:respondingViewGetter]];
        }
      }
      self.inputAccessoryView.responders = responders;
    }
    
    @end
    

Installation?
-------------

This project includes a `podspec` for usage with [CocoaPods](http://http://cocoapods.org/). Simply add

    pod 'JCDefaultFormInputAccessoryView'

to your `Podfile` and run `pod install`.

Alternately, you can add all of the files contained in this project's `Library` directory to your Xcode project. If your project does not use ARC, you will need to enable ARC on these files. You can enable ARC per-file by adding the -fobjc-arc flag, as described on [a common StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6646052/how-can-i-disable-arc-for-a-single-file-in-a-project).
